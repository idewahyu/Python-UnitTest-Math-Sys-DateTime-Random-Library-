## Argumen and Parameter
- Argument-Functions name for the input value when the function is called.
- The parameter is a value designation for input when the function is defined.

## Class, Object, and Method
- A Class is like a "blueprint" for creating objects. We can think of a class as a sketch (prototype) of a house.
- An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data.
- A method is a function that “belongs to” an object. (In Python, the term method is not unique to class instances: other object types can have methods as well. 

## import io
Stands for Input Output. Input involves inputting data from input devices, while output will display data to the user.

## import os
Function call with name os Os.system(“cls”) : clearscreen in your command prompt

## import UnitTest
Process to ensure that the code written is running properly. This goal can be achieved in a variety of ways, from manually entering some values ​​and making sure the results are correct, to creating a series of structured tests that run automatically and ensure that the entire program is running as it should.

## Random Library
Sometimes we need to add random variable in our data, to do that we can use random library

## Math
To do math operation in python like upperbound, lowerbound and insert a math formula in syntax 

## Sys
